jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. If you're new to jQuery, we recommend that you check out the [jQuery Learning Center](http://learn.jquery.com/).

If you're updating to a newer version of jQuery, be sure to read the release notes published on [our blog](http://blog.jquery.com/). If you're coming from a version prior 1.9, you should check out the [1.9 Upgrade](http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/) Guide as well.

Note that this is the API documentation for jQuery core. Other projects have API docs in other locations:
